## Too Long, Didn't Read

## Become a Pokemon Trainer

These rules will tell you everything you need to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game - Junior Edition. Your deck of cards represents your Pokemon team, and you will use them to battle against other Pokemon Trainers.

Trading card games are strategy based and use collectible cards to build decks that you use to battle against other players. The best way to learn is playing games with other people. You can play with your friends, family, or at a local game store.

Once you have learned the basics, you can start building your own deck and customizing it to your liking. You can collect cards by buying booster packs, trading with other players, or buying singles from a store.

## Pokemon TCG Junior Concepts

### How to Win

In the Pokemon TCG, your Pokemon battle against your opponent's Pokemon. The first player to knock out 3 of their opponent's Pokemon wins the game. Also, if your opponent has no Pokemon left in play, or if they run out of cards in their deck, you win the game!

### Energy Types

Pokemon Knock Out opposing Pokemon by using attacks or Abilities. To use these attacks, you need to attach Energy cards to your Pokemon. There are 11 Energy tpes, and you will find Pokemon that use different types of Energy.

Each Energy type powers different Pokemon attacks. Find the ones that match your personality! The Energy types are:

- Grass: Grass-type Pokemon often have attacks that heal themselves or Poison their opponents.
- Fire: Fire-type Pokemon have powerful attacks that can Burn their opponents.
- Water: Water-type Pokemon can manipulate Energy and move your opponent's Pokemon around.
- Lightning: Lightning-type Pokemon can bring back used energy from the discard pile and they can Paralyze their opponents.
- Psychic: Psychic-type Pokemon can move damage counters around; along with Confusing, Poisoning, or putting your opponent's Pokemon to Sleep.
- Fighting: Fighting-type Pokemon can deal extra damage and some can flip coins for combination hits.
- Darkness: Darkness-type Pokemon have sneaky attacks that often make opponents discard cards and can Poison their Pokemon.
- Metal: Metal-type Pokemon are tough and can reduce damage from attacks.
- Fairy: Fairy-type Pokemon have tricks that will make opposing Pokemon's attacks less effect. Since *Sword & Shield*, you'll find some Pokemon that used to be Fairy types showing up as Psychic types instead.
- Dragon: Dragon-type Pokemon have very powerful attacks, but often require two Energy types to use them.
- Colorless: Colorless-type Pokemon have lots of different moves, and they work with any kind of Energy.

## Parts of a Pokemon Card

Pokemon cards have a lot of information on them. Here are the most important parts:

**Pokemon Type**
: This tells you what type of Pokemon it is.

**Hit Points (HP)**
: This is how much damage the Pokemon can take before it is Knocked Out.

**Pokemon Name**
: This is the name of the Pokemon.

**Stage**
: This tells you if the Pokemon is Basic, Stage 1, or Stage 2.

**Evolution**
: This tells you what Pokemon you can evolve this Pokemon from.

**Attacks**
: This tells you what attacks the Pokemon can use. Each attack has an Energy cost, a attack name, and damage it does. For example, `3 Electric Energy - Thunder Shock - 40 damage`.

### Card Types

You'll find 2 different types of cards for the Pokemon TCG Junior edition:

**Pokemon**
The most important cards are Pokemon! Most of these cards are Basic Pokemon, Stage 1 Pokemon, and Stage 2 Pokemon. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Pokemon are also called Evolution cards. Look at the upper-left corner and you will see the Pokemon's Stage and the Pokemon it evolves from, if any.

**Energy Cards**
Most of the time, Pokemon can't attack without Energy cards! You'll need to match the symbols of the attack cost to the Energy card, but any of Energy can be used for 'Colorless'.

## Zones for the Game

**In Play**
: The in-play zone is shared by the players. Each player has two sections for their Pokemon. These two sections are the *Active Spot* and *Bench*.

**Active Spot**
: The top row of a player's in-play section is the Active Spot. Each player starts with (and must always have) one Pokemon in their Active Spot - this is the Active Pokemon. Each player must have only one Active Pokemon at a time. If your opponent doesn't have any more Pokemon in play, you win the game!

**Bench**
: The bottom row of a player's in-play section is for the Benched Pokemon. Each player may have up to 4 Pokemon on the Bench at any one time. Any Pokemon in play other than the Active Pokemon must be put on the Bench.

**Deck**
: Each play starts with their own deck of 20 cards to play the game. While both players know how many cards are in each deck, no one can look at or change the order of the cards in either player's deck.

**Discard Pile**
: Each player has their own discard pile. Cards taken out of play go to the discard pile. Typically when a Pokemon is Knocked Out, it and any attached cards (such as Energy cards) are sent to its owner's discard pile.

**Energy Pile**
: Below the *Discard Pile*, each player starts with their own stack of 20 Energy cards to use for the game. You'll want to make sure your Energy pile has the appropriate type(s) of Energy needed for your Pokemon.

**Hand**
: Each player draws 5 cards at the begining of the game and keeps their own hand hidden. Cards you draw go into your hand. Players make not look at their opponent's hand unless they ask for help.
